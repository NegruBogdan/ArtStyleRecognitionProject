# ArtStyleRecognitionProject

The model in this project attempts to decide if two given painting belong to the same art style. It'a twist on the Kaggle competion [**Painter by Numbers**](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/painter-by-numbers/overview) ,forced both by the limitations of the dataset provided (there only a few painting for any given painter, so training becomes ineffective) and in available processing power.
This model was the final project for the "Machine Learning in Computer Vision" university course.
